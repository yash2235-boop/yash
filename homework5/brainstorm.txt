1. Five topics:
	1. Variable stars - How Cepheid and RR Lyrae variable stars help astronomers measure distances to other galaxies.
	2. The role of dark matter in shaping galaxy rotation curves and structure.
	3. Fractals in nature and physics - specifically the bifurcation diagram
	4. Gravitational waves and black hole mergers
	5. Exoplanet detection techniques

2. Research papers:
Topic 1:
THE CARNEGIE-CHICAGO HUBBLE PROGRAM. I. AN INDEPENDENT APPROACH TO THE
EXTRAGALACTIC DISTANCE SCALE USING ONLY POPULATION II DISTANCE INDICATORS* - Beaton et al.
https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.3847/0004-637X/832/2/210/pdf

This paper presents the Carnegie-Chicago Hubble Program, which measures cosmic distances using Population II distance indicators such as RR Lyrae stars and the Tip of the Red Giant Branch (TRGB). The goal is to create a distance ladder independent of Cepheid variables and use it to refine the Hubble constant (H_0). By combining precise photometry from nearby galaxies with stellar population models, the authors demonstrate that RR Lyrae stars can serve as reliable standard candles. This study is closely related to my topic because it shows how variable stars are used to measure distances to other galaxies.

Topic 3:
A mathematical framework for critical transitions: bifurcations, fast-slow systems and stochastic dynamics - Christian Kuehn
https://arxiv.org/abs/1101.2899?utm

This paper develops a mathematical framework for understanding bifurcations and critical transitions in dynamical systems. Kuehn explains how sudden qualitative changes in system behavior occur when parameters cross certain thresholds, and how these transitions can be analyzed through fast–slow dynamics and stochastic effects. The study connects deterministic bifurcation theory with real-world systems that exhibit noise and gradual parameter shifts, such as climate models and biological populations. It also highlights how signs like increasing variance or slowing recovery can serve as early indicators of an approaching transition. This paper is useful for studying how complex physical or natural systems evolve and how small changes can trigger large, nonlinear responses.

Topic 4:
Introduction to gravitational wave astronomy - Nigel T. Bishop
https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.07675?utm_

This paper provides a comprehensive overview of gravitational wave astronomy, explaining how ripples in spacetime predicted by Einstein’s theory of general relativity can be detected and analyzed. The authors describe the main sources of gravitational waves, including binary black hole and neutron star mergers, and outline how detectors like LIGO and Virgo measure these signals using laser interferometry. The paper also discusses the theoretical modeling of waveforms, data analysis techniques for identifying signals within noise, and the importance of these observations for understanding the universe’s most energetic events. It serves as a clear introduction to the physics, detection methods, and scientific implications of gravitational waves.

3. I would do something similar to topic 1, but not exactly that. I would identify variable stars in Andromeda Galaxy using data from HST which is available on the MAST website. Once we learn how to process FITS files, I can use loops like "for" to loop through each FITS file for each brick of the PHAT survey. I can also use conditions like "if" to filter out poor data based on signal to noise ratio and remove cosmic rays.

Dream version:
Make a Python program that looks through many HST images of the Andromeda Galaxy, finds stars that appear in more than one image, and checks how their brightness and color change over time. The program would automatically find variable stars, make simple light curves, and show them on color–color diagrams.

Simpler version:
Write a Python script that opens a few HST FITS files, removes noise and cosmic rays, and makes a color-color diagram showing possible variable-star candidates in one small area of Andromeda.
